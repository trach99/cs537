########################### Points from the git Repo ###########################

1. block size = 512B

2. every inode always starts at the location divisible by 512, "allocate" full 512B for each inode.

4. The disk is a file -> but you mmap the file -> so then you are working with memory

2. number of inodes in the file system         =  command line argument to mkfs.command
   number of data blocks in the file system    =  command line argument to mkfs.command (multiple of 32)

in raid 1 if data blocks is 224 then it means that each disk has 224 data blocks
in raid 0 it means you have 224 data blocks in total


creating an empty file system vs mounting 

1. initializing the ds on the empty disk for the  filesystem 
2. making it ready to be mountable

mounting = going & actually using the ds within the file system


####################### Piazza Clarifications #######################

@1042 : root directory inode number = 0

@1042 : Disks are just files, so their name could (theoretically) be up to 255 characters.
           You don't need to ensure that the superblock is less than 512 bytes. 

@1046 : Names of the disks are not important & can change. 

@1046 : The fields you add into superblock can differ (and will differ) to store disk order

@1074 : All metadata except superblock are identical on all drives.

@1076 : Yes you can assume all disks are of the same size.

@1084 : No entries should be allocated to "." & "..". They are virtual concepts

@1108 : think of correct operation as return 0, 
        usage errors as return 1, 
        and runtime errors as return -1. 
        For cases like this, just follow the behavior in the tests.

@1110 : include your #define etc 30 before your fuse.h line

@1114 : use man 7 inode to learn about the different inode fields

@1118 : Filenames are irrelevant. What matters is the content of your filesystem. 
        Hence you have to store as much information as you need in your filesystem.

@1121 : Size of root node = 0 Reason: no allocated blocks or entries in empty FS

@1121 : To assign uid & gid, use the uid & gid of the calling process

@1125 : What is the max number of blocks ? 
        It depends how large the disk file is.
        There needs to be enough physical space in the file to fit all the requested blocks.

@1130 : number of inodes have to rounded to 32, since inodes are also stored in blocks

@1138 : manage memory leaks as best practice.

@1200 : in wfs_dentry the num field stands for inode_num

##################################  to do  ##################################

// piazza post for why the test-7 has something in the out file
// change mode_t using s_isreg | 0700
// time function in 
// do the unmap in mkfs & map the disks again in wfs.c
// piazza : what does number of blocks really means in raid 0 vs 1. they mean the logical number of blocks


##############################################################################

when they give the "total number of blocks in the system" in mkfs what does it include 
data blocks only ?
data blocks + inode blocks + other metadata ?



1. what is pre-rc ? what is rc ? 
2. how does the tester code work ? why is there no c-file to check what the tester is doing ?

   is Each disk is of the same size ? No

3. what do the cmd line args mean in each mode ?
   total inodes in the system 
   total "data" blocks in the system (data blocks + inode blocks)

4. what do you include in the metadata that needs to be copied to each disk always 
   . superblock
   . inode bitmap
   . data bitmap
   . inodes

   Yes

5. what if the total number of blocks = total size of all the disks ?

6. In theory, the inode number wasn't stored in the inode ? how is it stored there ? inode num is the index in bitmap

7. Are we doing the mmap wrong ? were we supposed to do it after the mounting which happens in wfs.happens

unmap at the end of mkfs program 

8. how to see what is happening in the disk image ? xxd -e .. command







####################### Test Cases #######################

1. mkfs: default fs, two disks
2. mkfs: large fs, four disks
3. mkfs: one disk is too few
4. mkfs: default fs, striped
5. mkfs: round blocks correctly 1
6. mkfs: round blocks correctly 2
7. mkfs: bad raid mode
8. mkfs: too many blocks requested
9. mkfs: odd number of disks okay

43. raid1 -- read: large file
44. raid1 -- interleaved writes and readback
51. raid0 -- read: small file
52. raid0 -- read: large file
53. raid0 -- interleaved writes and readback
56. raid0 -- mount in other order with readback



47. raid0 -- rm: create previously deleted file with data
57. raid1v -- readback with a corrupted disk

// -x-

a check the condition of the too many blocks requested for different raid modes

b find out the functions to add time to the inode -> check if time(NULL) is the correct method 
   also check if why does it start from 1970

c check whether your understanding of the inode bit map is correct
   1. use unsigned initializing
   2. this gives me 32-bits per element
   3. set all uint elements to 0
   4. set only the 1st bit LSB to 1 for the root inode

d check whether what u have written to the inode is correct


###########################################################################################################

1. Every file/directory has an inode. Each directory stores dirents in its data blocks. In RAID0 these dirents 
   will be striped.

2. I don't understand RAID1v. Why will a block be in majority when all drives store the exact same blocks ??
this deals with data corruption. what if 1 disk is corrupted then you need to check all disks to make sure u
have the ryt block in majority

3. number of hardlinks to the root inode in an empty filesystem. doesn't matter
directory always has a reference to itself

no explicit dirents for . & .. 

4. What is the output in 3.out. no problem

5. does the root node have a directory entry ? eg. stat mnt  
mnt is the mount point not a directory in the filesystem

6. what do dirents store ? file name or full file path. filename

7. will the cli args given to wfs maintain order : disks > fuse_op > mnt. No jumbling

8. will paths given always be absolute paths from mnt ?
paths start at root 
fuse things can handle internal mkdirs search online

traversal algo -> search for directory entry of the next name in the previous directory. 




// Doubts post thanksgiving



1. when calling write is it assumed that the file is open() with the correct permissions ?
2. or do we need to open the file
3. return codes in mkfs



if command line args are wrong its a usage error

the -b in mkfs command line args implies the number of data blocks needed in 1 disk or the size of the d-bitmap in the disk

the index of blocks array % cnt_disks gives the disk in raid mode 0
index at 0th block will always be stored on disk 0
index at 1st block will always be stored on disk 1



/// DOUBTS ////

1. size manipulation for overwriting files
2. when i clear dentry should i check if the d-block is empty ?
current case : 1 dentry in dentry-block -> it is removed -> but directory holds onto the dentry block -> new file created 
-> new dentry block assigned because condition is only to check size 
currently i remove the dentry block unless it is blocks[0]
3. empty directory but multiple allocated data blocks for dentrys that were cleared in the past
4. tc 36 & 39 want 1 d-block inspite of no dentry


does rmdir only work on empty directories ?
